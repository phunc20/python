## Origin
These notebooks are simply re-writes of the materials
shared on <https://taborlab.github.io/FlowCal/python_tutorial/index.html>.

The reason for doing this is to tailor them to my own habits.


## Caveat
1. `FlowCal`'s github repo seems to have been updated without its
   [tutorial page](https://taborlab.github.io/FlowCal/python_tutorial/)
   being updated at the same time.  
   In particular, there no longer exists the file path `FlowCal/examples/FCFiles/Data001.fcs`
    - Neither `FlowCal/examples/FCFiles/sample001.fcs`
    - Nor `FlowCal/test/Data001.fcs`
   is the same as the one presented in the tutorial
