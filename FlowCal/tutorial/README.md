## Origin
These notebooks are simply re-writes of the materials
shared on <https://flowcal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>.
More specifically, we are on `FlowCal==1.3.0`.

The reason for doing this is to tailor them to my own habits.

Other related resources are
- <https://pypi.org/project/FlowCal/>


## Caveat
1. Had you landed on a different doc page, e.g.
   <https://taborlab.github.io/FlowCal/python_tutorial/>,
   there risks to exist a few discrepencies btw there and here. In particular,
    - The file `FlowCal/examples/FCFiles/Data001.fcs` no longer exists
