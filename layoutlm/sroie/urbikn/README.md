## File Explanations
- `02-infer_on_new_images_v02.ipynb` loads LayoutLM model and infers an instance without using the Python script `run_seq_labeling.py` to make the process of inference clearer. The code was from the same `microsoft/unilm`.
- `Receipt-Processor-AI-Builder-in-Canvas-App-9.png` is just a random receipt image that I downloaded form the Internet.
